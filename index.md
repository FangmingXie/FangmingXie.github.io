I am [Fangming Xie](./CV.md), a Physics PhD student in Prof. Eran Mukamel's [lab](https://brainome.ucsd.edu) at UCSD.

[Here](https://brainome.ucsd.edu/BICCN_MOp) are some data of mouse brain cell transcriptomes and epigenomes, which displays the DNA methylation, chromatin accessibility, and gene expression profiles of 56 neuronal cell types identified from >400,000 single cells from the mouse primary motor cortex. More details are in [this](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.29.970558v2) preprint.
